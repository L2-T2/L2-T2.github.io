# About Me

## Introduction

I am currently pursuing an **MSc in Mathematics** at the **University of Copenhagen**. My research interests span across multiple domains, with a particular focus on the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and computational methods.

### Research Interests

My work centers on understanding causal relationships and developing robust statistical methods:

- **Causal Inference**: Developing and applying methods to understand cause-and-effect relationships in complex systems
- **Causal Discovery**: Algorithmic approaches to learning causal structures from observational data
- **High-Dimensional Statistics**: Statistical methods for analyzing data with many variables
- **Narrative Systems**: Exploring the mathematical structure of narratives and storytelling
- **Digital Humanities**: Applying computational and statistical methods to humanities research
