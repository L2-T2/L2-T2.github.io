Whether it’s an assignment in school or something at work, the most important thing is finish it on time.<br>for example, if you don’t finish something on time, you may affected ohter’s work which depends on what you did.<br>last summer vacation, I had an internship in the government for some clerical work. At that time, I made a huge mistake which is about delaying.<br>I was drafting an IPO review for a company, but I couldn’t find some relevant documents, and other officers went out to have a session. So I decided to do it later, but I forgot it until noon. I just go straight to have lunch. As soon as I get to work this afternoon, the chief ask me about the draft, I recalled it out of sudden but I had nothing to offer to him. At that moment, I was so akward, but the only thing I can told him was I hadn’t finish it.<br>because of my fault, the next step had been delay too, so my co-worker need to spend time with me to save the problem even it was a long time after we off duty.

But now, I think I haven’t thought this through, because I don’t need the performanceof M1 and the large size of the ipad pro, I should use this money to buy an ipad air and the macnook air, which are suitable for me now.</p>
<p>15.忙碌经历<br>because I only had one moring, and I arrive at this place at 9 o’clock, so there were about two hours for me to check the exam room out.<br>went back home to have a revison.<br>11.使用地图的经历<br>the winter vacation in this year, I went to University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, because the last time I took part in the International English Language Testing System was in the school.<br>usually I’d like to check where I was by the Gao De Map on my cell phone. But the location in the university is very vague in school, so I have to read the paper maps.<br>it was different to using the electronic map, because when you check the place you were on the cell phone, the only thing you need to consider was the mark which meant where you are, then you just went as the mark moved. But use the paper maps, I need to recogonize the buildings around me, match the different buildings to their names on the map.<br>Before, I wouldn’t have remembered what was on the path I took, but after this experience, I can remember everthing I pass by, and I have the confidence to show others the way this time.</p>
<p>9.喜欢的聚会<br>My high school classmate’s 18th birthday. In the culture of China, turning 18 means you’re an adult, so this year’s birthday has a very important symbolic meaning<br>he invited us come to his home to have a party. At first, he planed to guest us with his relatives, but at that day, he decided to guest us by himself which wont make us akward. so we rent a place for the party.<br>the people came to here were all the high school classmates, we all know about each other.<br>we plan to have a hot pot. and decided to do it by ourselves, so we divide the work, some people go out to buy vegetables and meal. some people make the preparation. And I with one mate did a unique work, it is waiting on the side, because we were not good at cooking, and were kicked out of the kitchen for making a mess.<br>but after the dinner, I wash the dishes.<br>at that time we were immersed in the joy of entering the dreamed school, and there were no worries about what work can we do in the furture. of can we have a master program of our subject.<br>we just played some games , made someone sing. everyone was satisfied.<br>but now recall this experience, I just feel depressed, because some of them we haven’t meet anymore, and some of us was anxious about the furture.</p>
<p>14.和老人的有趣谈话<br>landlord, ask me to pay him the money for one year’s rent one time.<br>I’m shocked at his request at first, because usually, renting an apartment is giving three months’ money for the rent at first as deposit, and then you pay it once a month.<br>I only have to rent this house for a year, why should I pay all at once.<br>then he gives me an interesting reason, he is a typical chengdu man who enjoy a slow life pace, so the things he usually do is hanging out in the morning, playing cards in the afternoon and then picking his grandson at 5 o’clock, so if I pay him once a month, it is a small amount, he may spend it in few days and without any burdensome. But if we pay all at once, the number of the rents will make him think about how use the money where it’s needs.<br>I was amused by his response. But that’s kind of true, because I also think a couple money is nothing in my daily life, but when I account them at the end of the month, it accumulated to a huge number.<br>This conversation has inspired me. after all，the rent is paid twice a year. Not having to pay rent once a month is easy for both us.</p>
<p>16.噪音<br>hear it in my house where I rent for my study. from the windows I can see a garden in the first floor of the building which built against mine, and the owner of it has five dogs. I was astonished at it when I saw it, I can’t image how energy the keeper was to hold them.<br>so, you may realize who is the main character of the noise, each time the walkman pass this garden, the dogs will bark at him. and they made a very loud noise. Not only at six o’clock in the morning when it’s still light, but at twelve o’clock in the middle of the night.<br>neighborhood committee，ask the keeper to control his dogs, But it only plays a small role，I can still hear the loud barking now and then during the daytime.</p>
<p>4.糟糕的服务<br>18.听到投诉<br>complain at a restaurant, because there were so many people ,so many people were in line<br>in the winter vacation this year, I and my friends came to have lunch at Chunxi Road, we chose the To To Kui to enjoy the  Cantonese morning tea, the traditional food in Guangdong region<br>luckly, we ordered the place in advance, so we can go straight into this restaurant.<br>after us,a few people who had ordered in advance arrived at the restaurant there in succession, but one of the waited people disagreed, he thought it was unfair they had waiting for a long time, but these people came after can eat first. anf shouted to the waiter to ask their manager to deal with it.<br>explain the reason,  apologize to these people and promise will give them some discount.<br>I think it was not the waiters and manager’s fault, It was this customer who was making a fuss<br>We should follow the principle of first come, first served, but only if no one has made an advance reservation<br>but the restaurant could  prepare a sign that tells you how many people are eating and gives you a maximum waiting time</p>
<p>19.速战速决<br>grab a seat in the classroom, open classes, so many people especially the ideological and political course. The teacher is very demanding eople in bad positions are often asked questions.<br>but you know, on the sleepy classes there are few people listen to the teacher, so a good postion is very important.<br>this term, we have class like this in Thuesday’s afternoon, at 4 o’clock, and I dont have class before, so the job come here in advance belongs to me.<br>I think it’s necessary, expected some people need high score in this class, it’s no use for us and meaningless, so we choose to do our own things on the class such as other class’s homework.<br>but I think we shouldn’t play games on the class although we don’t listen to the teacher, is the basis rule of class.</p>
<p>21.捡到遗失的物品<br>high school, on the stair turn in the teaching building,<br>a book written the name of it’s owner,called wanting, and some notes on the page of foreword. so it’s precious to the owner. it was some of her teacher sent this book to her.<br>but the time I found it was on Friday, and we had the holiday on the weekends, so I could only to return this book to the girl on Sunday’s evening.<br>at that time, I found this girl in her class. First she was puzzled for why a stranger came to find her, but after I told the reason, she thanks me a lot ,even some tears came from her eyes.<br>Her schoolbag wasn’t pulled up properly, and got bumped by someone at the corner at Friday, maybe that time her lost this book.<br>spend childhood with books, so I can understand her feeling, after that we became friend.</p>
<p>22.旅行延期<br>summer vacation after the national college entrance examination<br>my parents asked me to get a driver’s license, so there’s little time for myself to maneged about.<br>the only chance to travel this vacation, before and after it had things to do<br>because my classmate who was going to with me had a sudden fever. so If I don’t change the time, I have to travel alone.<br>at the same time, another friend asked me to have a trip to Qingdao, enjoy the beauty of the sea.<br>so I think waiting a while to trip with the other friends should be better than being on my own.<br>it’s a pity to miss out such an opportunity, and we went away to study, we were in different places and we haven’t seen each other since then.</p>
<p><strong>事物类</strong><br>1.描述一张让你开心的照片<br>11.家中重要的物品<br>photograph of the entire family, I have a big family,  just my mom has nine brothers and sisters.<br>and my mother is the youngest in her generation, and same do I. So before I finish my study, Im an uncle of six children. so you can image, on this photo there are so many people, The oldest is 80 years old and the youngest is 2 years old, through four generation. After the deaths of my grandmother and my third uncle last year, this photo became more precious.<br>we take this photo on2021, in our homtown.<br>there is an old custom of our culture is that offering sacrifices to one’s ancestors, at this moment the falmily will get together, and in the spring festival, to sweep the tombs. we will discuss about the people in the photo.<br>family affection is the bond between family members, and this photo is a visualization of that bond.</p>
